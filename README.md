## 🎯 Overview

This project automatically updates your GitHub profile README (e.g., `Your-Username/Your-Username`) with your latest projects based on repository topics/tags. It uses a GitHub Action to run a Python script daily, fetch your tagged projects, and commit the changes back to your README.

## ✨ Features

* **🔄 Automatic Daily Updates:** Runs on a schedule (e.g., every day at midnight UTC).
* **🏷️ Tag-Based Filtering:** Only displays repos with topics you define (e.g., `showcase`, `ai`, `rag`).
* **🎨 Custom Image Support:** Automatically finds and uses a custom preview image (e.g., `RepoName.png`) from your project, or falls back to the standard GitHub OpenGraph image.
* **📱 Mobile Responsive:** The generated HTML cards work perfectly on all devices.
* **⏰ Last Updated Timestamp:** Shows exactly when the project list was last refreshed.
* **🚀 Zero Maintenance:** Set it and forget it.
